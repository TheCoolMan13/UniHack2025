Ok so now i will explain the project to you and i would like you to remenber everything i say . So it goes like this :
We are going to make a mobile app that is used for car shareing.
Use case :
I need to go to work every day from point A to point B from Monday to Friday at 7:30 in the morning. On the app i can find somebody that goes from point C to D and passes through A and B , something like C -> A -> B -> D  at the same time as me. I want to share the ride with that person and pay him a commision.
The app has to be user friendly and have almost a Google/Uber feel to it, with modern ui.
We need to implement a map system for the user.
We will use ReactNative for the fronend and probably Node.js for the backend
You will write code under the standard implementation.
Follow clean component structure.
Use functional components with hooks.
Write reusable code.
Comment and explain logic clearly.
Stick to best practices (ESLint-friendly, no inline styles unless simple).
